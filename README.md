# fasta_grabber
This is python code written for a project I did in 2020 to get sequences from NCBI in .fasta format. Used biopython.
It was a solution to getting nucleotide sequences where the gene is at.
This is when I was still new to python so it is very rough but interesting as my first project upload.
